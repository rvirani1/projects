# What methods do strings have that symbols don't? Describe a few.
# There are methods like to reverse since you may actually reverse something.
# There are also methods like sub and gub to replace characters.
# There are other methods like ascii only. Basically there are lots of methods to manipulate the characters in the string
# This makes sense since the content of a string is assumed to be significant for actual end user use

# What methods do symbols have that strings don't?
# There is an id2name function that converts the symbol to a string, which obviously doesn't need to be there for other stuff
# There is also pretty_print_cycle and it does some stuff.
# There is also a method to convert the symbol to a proc.
