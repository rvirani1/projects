3. Write a number guessing game
* The computer should pick a random number
* The player guesses, and the computer says if the guess is high or low
* Play proceeds until the player gets the number or runs out of guesses
Bonus: reverse the game (so the player chooses and the computer guesses). What's
    the best strategy for the computer? Can you define others?
